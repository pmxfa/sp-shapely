\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Rationale}
The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has fueled an increasing demand for high-quality data that can be used to train and test these systems \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022, goyal_systematic_2024}. However, access to real-world data often comes with significant challenges, including privacy concerns, data scarcity, and algorithmic biases \parencite{lu_machine_2024, hudovernik_benchmarking_2024}. In recent years, synthetic data generation has emerged as a viable solution to these challenges \parencite{goyal_systematic_2024}.

While synthetic data provides a promising alternative to real-world data, its effectiveness largely relies on its quality, which can be assessed based on fidelity and usability. Fidelity evaluates how closely the synthetic data replicates the statistical properties of the original data, while usability assesses its efficacy in supporting ML tasks \parencite{loni_review_2025}. These dimensions are interdependent: high fidelity ideally enhances usability, assuming the original data is reliable. However, if the original dataset contains flaws or biases, replicating it with high fidelity might only perpetuate its limitations \parencite{shahul_hameed_bias_2024}. Thus, it is essential for synthetic data to not simply mimic the original data but also address and improve upon its deficiencies to ensure greater usability.

This study aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various generative models in producing synthetic datasets that are both statistically similar to real data (high fidelity) and practically useful in ML applications (high usability). The ultimate goal is to identify models that can best mitigate the shortcomings of low-quality datasets, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of machine learning systems. Utilizing a Shapley-based analysis, this research quantitatively assesses each generative model's contribution to the quality of synthetic data. This comprehensive evaluation seeks to determine each model's capability not only to adhere closely to the statistical properties of the original data but also to enhance the effectiveness of downstream ML applications. By dissecting the contributions of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and their combined applications in time series data generation, the study aims to pinpoint which models provide the optimal balance between fidelity and usability.
\subsection{Statement of the Problem}

Generative models, including GANs, VAEs, and their hybrids, have demonstrated significant potential in addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns through synthetic data generation. However, the effectiveness of these models in producing high-quality synthetic time series data, particularly when evaluated against the dual metrics of fidelity and usability, remains underexplored. Current evaluation approaches in synthetic data generation lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand which specific model components contribute most to overall performance and how these contributions vary across different data contexts.

This leads to a notable research gap: there is no established interpretable methodology for evaluating which generative models best navigate the trade-offs between fidelity and usability in time series data applications. Existing comparative studies typically rely on aggregate performance metrics that obscure the individual contributions of different model architectures, limiting practitioners' ability to make informed decisions about model selection and optimization strategies.

Addressing this gap, this study employs a Shapley-based analysis to provide interpretable insights into generative model performance. This approach moves beyond traditional black-box comparisons to offer transparent attribution of each model's contribution to synthetic data quality. The Shapley framework enables practitioners to understand not only which models perform best, but why they perform well and how their effectiveness varies across different data characteristics. Such interpretable insights are crucial for advancing the use of synthetic datasets, particularly in environments where understanding model behavior is as important as achieving high performance, such as in regulated industries where explainable AI is increasingly required.

\subsubsection{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can fidelity and usability metrics be effectively integrated into a comparative evaluation of generative models for time series synthetic data generation?
    \item What trade-offs exist between fidelity and usability in synthetic data generation, and how do these trade-offs affect downstream machine learning tasks?
    \item Which generative model most effectively balances fidelity and usability to produce high-quality synthetic time series data?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Significance of the Study}
This study addresses a critical gap in the literature on synthetic data generation, particularly focusing on the balance between fidelity and usability in datasets generated for time series applications. While generative models like GANs, VAEs, and their hybrids have shown promise in isolated studies, there remains a substantial need for a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses these models based on their ability to produce high-quality synthetic datasets.

By applying a Shapley-based analysis, this study provides a systematic approach for assessing how well synthetic data supports machine learning tasks while maintaining statistical similarity to real data. This dual-focus approach is crucial because generating high-quality synthetic data requires more than mere replication of the original data’s statistical features; it must also enhance the data's practical utility for machine learning tasks, particularly when the original datasets are flawed or biased.

The outcomes of this study are expected to significantly impact the field by providing actionable insights that can guide the development and refinement of generative models. Identifying models that effectively balance these two critical dimensions will help researchers and practitioners in fields where the quality of synthetic data is particularly important for overcoming challenges like data scarcity and bias without sacrificing the data’s utility.

\subsection{Scopes and Delimitations of the Study}
This study focuses on evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by specific generative models—Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and their hybrid (GAN-VAES)—within the context of time series applications. The primary evaluation framework integrates the concept of fidelity and usability. These two concepts are treated as interrelated aspects of data quality, rather than as separate, isolated evaluative criteria.

\subsubsection{Delimitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Privacy Metrics:} While privacy is crucial for synthetic data, especially in regulated fields, this study excludes privacy metrics to maintain a clear focus on evaluating synthetic data quality through fidelity and usability. Integrating privacy metrics would broaden the scope of the research and require more complex methodologies, such as differential privacy techniques, which would complicate the evaluation process and possibly overshadow the evaluation of the other metrics. The exclusion of privacy metrics allows this research to provide a more concentrated and detailed analysis of how well synthetic data replicates statistical properties and supports machine learning tasks. By focusing exclusively on fidelity and usability, the study aims to offer deeper insights into the core aspects of synthetic data quality without the confounding effects of integrating privacy considerations, which could be addressed in future research.

    \item \textbf{Generative Models:} The study limits its analysis to GANs, VAEs, and their hybrid GAN-VAEs. Other types of generative models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines or Diffusion Models, are not included in this assessment. This delimitation is based on the established capability of the selected models to handle time series data effectively, which is central to the research questions posed.

    \item \textbf{Dataset Size:} To manage computational costs and training time, the study employs datasets standardized to contain a maximum of 5000 samples. This ensures consistent and efficient evaluation across all models without compromising the integrity of the results.
    
    \item \textbf{General Applications:} The study focuses on general synthetic data generation for time series applications and is not tailored to specific domains such as healthcare or finance. While the methods used in this research could be adapted for domain-specific applications, the findings are intended to provide insights that are broadly applicable.

    \item \textbf{Evaluation Focus:} The study does not aim to separately optimize fidelity and usability metrics but rather examines the balance and trade-offs between them in producing high-quality synthetic data. This approach is chosen to better understand how improvements in one aspect might affect the other, providing a holistic view of model performance. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Representation:} The findings are limited to the datasets used in this study, which include time series datasets of varying dimensionality.  These datasets, selected for their relevance to existing literature and practicality, may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world time series data.

    \item \textbf{Evaluation Scope:} The evaluation is limited to forecasting tasks using LSTM as the downstream application for utility assessment, which may not generalize to other machine learning tasks such as classification or clustering.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Constraints:} The decision to limit dataset size and use simpler forecasting models reflect practical constraints and may not capture the full potential of generative models under larger-scale experiments.

    \item \textbf{Exclusion of Privacy Metrics: } While privacy metrics are not included in this study, their absence represents a potential area for future exploration. This limitation reflects a deliberate decision to focus on fidelity and usability, which are critical dimensions of synthetic data quality. Privacy-preserving synthetic data generation is only meaningful if the synthetic data itself has high fidelity and usability. By ensuring that the foundation of synthetic data quality is addressed first, this study creates a strong basis for exploring privacy considerations in future work. However, the exclusion of privacy metrics means this study does not evaluate the extent to which the generated datasets mitigate risks of privacy breaches, leaving this as an area for further exploration.

\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Overview of Synthetic Data Generation}

Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data produced through specialized mathematical models or algorithms, specifically designed to address particular data science tasks \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022}. According to \cite{jordon_synthetic_2022}, synthetic data serves as a tool to address various challenges in data science, including privacy concerns, bias, and data scarcity, without directly exposing sensitive information. This view is further supported by \cite{goyal_systematic_2024} who have highlighted the increasing recognition of synthetic data for its potential to address pressing real-world issues such as mitigating data scarcity, addressing privacy concerns, and reducing algorithmic biases— issues common in machine learning applications. Similarly, \cite{emam_practical_2020} emphasizes that although it is not real data, synthetic data is generated based on the statistical properties of the original dataset, ensuring it mirrors the original data in terms of patterns and distributions. This approach enables for the preservation of statistical integrity while mitigating risks related to data privacy breaches.  

Expanding on these definitions, synthetic data has seen widespread adoption in a variety of fields, where the aforementioned challenges are most pronounced. This is especially evident in the healthcare domain, where access to relevant datasets is often constrained due to privacy and scarcity. A study by \cite{skandarani_gans_2021} illustrates this through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate medical images to enable meaningful research. This application is further elaborated by \cite{habiba_ecg_2021}, who investigated ECG synthesis using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and GAN models, demonstrating another facet of how synthetic data can support advancements in medical research. Similarly, in other domains like finance, where there is a need for balanced datasets and anonymization, synthetic data has proven beneficial as exemplified by \cite{caliskan_comparative_2023}, comparatively analyzing the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) for generating synthetic financial credit load data. Additionally, synthetic data is also used in network traffic simulation \parencite{cullen_evaluation_2022}, supporting cybersecurity applications through the generation of anonymized datasets.

Despite its utility, there remains significant open challenges in the field of synthetic data generation. A recurring theme across the related literature is the lack of well-agreed metrics for evaluating the quality, utility, and privacy of synthetic data \parencite{goyal_systematic_2024, caliskan_comparative_2023, bauer_comprehensive_2024, lu_machine_2024}. This absence of well-agreed evaluation methods makes it a challenging task to compare the performance of different models, such as GANs, VAEs, and Neural ODEs, and to determine which model is best suited for a given application, as observed in a systematic review by \cite{goyal_systematic_2024}. For example, while some studies rely on statistical difference evaluations like Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or Wasserstein distance \parencite{li_his-gan_2019}, others employ human evaluation or application-specific metrics to assess synthetic data quality \parencite{lu_machine_2024}, which further contributes to the inconsistencies in evaluation. Beyond evaluation, the balance between fidelity and privacy also remains a critical issue, with multiple studies emphasizing the difficulty of generating data that mirrors the original dataset while protecting sensitive information \parencite{goyal_systematic_2024}. Additional issues include propagation of biases \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022}, fairness issues \parencite{lu_machine_2024}, high computational costs \parencite{bauer_comprehensive_2024} and the lack of robust privacy-preserving techniques \parencite{kaabachi_scoping_2024}.

In light of the challenges discussed above, it is evident that the field of synthetic data generation is at a crucial juncture. Given the growing reliance on machine learning models across sectors, understanding how to measure the quality and impact of synthetic data will become increasingly important. Thus, the study of metrics for evaluating synthetic data—in terms of both privacy protection and data utility—will be a critical area of future research. Such metrics will not only improve synthetic data's applicability across industries but also enhance trust in its use for privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.

\subsection{Metrics for Evaluating Synthetic Data}

As the field of synthetic data generation evolves, the need for robust and widely-accepted metrics to evaluate the quality, utility, and privacy of synthetic data has become increasingly apparent. These metrics are essential not only for ensuring that synthetic data serves practical purposes but also for guaranteeing its ethical use in sensitive applications such as healthcare \parencite{kaabachi_scoping_2024}. Evaluation metrics are crucial for determining how well synthetic data replicates the original dataset while maintaining privacy, ensuring the data’s usability, and avoiding unintended consequences such as the leakage of sensitive information \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022,kaabachi_scoping_2024}. In the literature, synthetic data evaluation metrics are broadly categorized into two categories: utility metrics and privacy metrics \parencite{goncalves_generation_2020,kaabachi_scoping_2024}. 

Utility metrics play a key role in assessing how well synthetic data retains the essential characteristics of the original data, ensuring its usefulness for tasks such as machine learning model training and data analysis. As defined by Hittmeir et al. (2019), utility metrics quantify how useful synthetic data is by assessing how much information is lost during the data generation process.  In this way, they help determine how closely the synthetic data mirrors the original, supporting its use in real-world applications. These utility metrics can be further divided into general and task-specific metrics \parencite{kaabachi_scoping_2024,osorio-marulanda_privacy_2024}.

General utility metrics assess the overall statistical properties and model evaluation results for a wide range of potential analyses that could be performed on the data \parencite{el_emam_seven_2020}. These metrics focus on preserving key statistical attributes of the original dataset, such as the distribution of variables, means, variances, and correlations. Commonly used general utility metrics include KL Divergence and Wasserstein Distance, both of which measure the similarity between the probability distributions of the real and synthetic data \parencite{fonseca_tabular_2023}. While general utility metrics provide a broad assessment of how well synthetic data mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset, task-specific utility metrics evaluate synthetic data based on how well it supports specific tasks, such as machine learning applications. These metrics focus on the performance of models trained on synthetic data when applied to real-world tasks. Common task-specific utility metrics used in research include machine learning efficacy metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score \parencite{figueira_survey_2022}. This approach is particularly useful in classification tasks, where the goal is to determine whether the synthetic data can be used to train models that perform comparably to those trained on real data \parencite{kaabachi_scoping_2024}. 

In addition to utility metrics, privacy metrics are crucial for evaluating the extent to which synthetic data protects sensitive information in the original dataset. Differential Privacy (DP) is one of the most widely recognized privacy metrics, providing a formal framework that quantifies the privacy guarantees of a data release mechanism \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022,goyal_systematic_2024,kaabachi_scoping_2024,nikolenko_synthetic_2019}. Similarly, Distance to Closest Record (DCR) offers another valuable perspective by measuring the distance between each synthetic data point and its nearest neighbor in the real training dataset \parencite{mendelevitch_fidelity_2021}.

In evaluating synthetic data generation, one of the most significant challenges is the inconsistency in comparative evaluations of different methods, which arises from the lack of uniform evaluation metrics \parencite{chundawat_tabsyndex_2024}. This inconsistency leads to confusion and variability in determining the effectiveness of synthetic data. As different models and applications prioritize various aspects, such as privacy, accuracy, or utility, establishing a common ground for evaluation becomes problematic. For example, while some methods may focus on enhancing privacy, others might aim to improve the accuracy or utility of the synthetic data, resulting in a diverse range of metrics that are not easily comparable. In response to these discrepancies, there have been concerted efforts within the research community to develop more unified evaluation metrics. One notable example is TabSynDex by~\cite{chundawat_tabsyndex_2024}, a single-score metric designed to robustly evaluate synthetic tabular data. Another innovative metric that has been developed is SHAPr \parencite{duddu_shapr_2022}, a Shapley-value based privacy metric which offers a versatile tool for measuring privacy risks.

However, these efforts encounter additional complexities. A prominent issue is the difficulty in balancing the trade-offs between privacy and utility. Enhancing privacy typically involves introducing mechanisms that may degrade the utility of the data by reducing its accuracy or limiting the types of analysis that can be performed effectively. This trade-off is particularly problematic in fields requiring high-fidelity data for accurate analysis, such as healthcare and finance, where both high utility and stringent privacy are critical \parencite{mendelevitch_fidelity_2021,caliskan_comparative_2023}. Moreover, many existing studies and methodologies fail to thoroughly evaluate residual privacy risks, especially concerning publicly released synthetic data \parencite{kaabachi_scoping_2024}. This oversight can lead to significant privacy breaches, as residual information may still be exploited to uncover sensitive data about individuals in the original dataset. Lastly, the metrics currently employed often struggle to capture complex relationships and dependencies between multiple attributes in the data. This deficiency can lead to synthetic datasets that, while statistically similar to original datasets in marginal distributions, fail to preserve more complex interdependencies, thus limiting their usefulness for more sophisticated data science tasks \parencite{jordon_synthetic_2022}.

\subsection{Survey of Generative Deep Learning Models}

Generative deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for creating synthetic data, increasingly becoming relevant in fields like healthcare, finance, and security, where data privacy and scarcity are major concerns. These models aim to capture the underlying data distribution of the training set in order to produce samples that reflect the learned distribution \parencite{carvajal-patino_synthetic_2022}. For example, GANs use an adversarial framework where the generator learns to model the data distribution by producing synthetic samples that fool a discriminator, which is trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. Similarly, VAEs utilize an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder maps data into a latent space and the decoder generates new samples by reconstructing data from this latent representation. Prior to the development of deep learning models, early generative approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) paved the way by capturing simple probabilistic relationships in data. However, as Cao et al. (2023) notes, it was the advent of deep learning that brought major performance advancements, allowing generative models to handle complex, high-dimensional data distributions. This idea is supported by~\cite{caliskan_comparative_2023}, who suggest that the proliferation of deep learning algorithms and emergence of generative techniques offers more promising solutions in the generation of financial credit loan data. This leap in capability has established deep learning-based models as central to modern synthetic data generation. 

With the rise of deep learning, models such as GANs and VAEs have emerged as foundational generative models that leverage neural networks to capture and reproduce complex data distributions in high-dimensional spaces. GANs, introduced by~\cite{goodfellow_generative_2014}, use an adversarial framework involving two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. More specifically, the generator begins with random noise as its input and strives to produce data whose distribution challenges the discriminator’s ability to classify it as real or synthetic. Based on the discriminator’s classification results, the gradients of the generator are updated to better approximate the real data distribution \parencite{zia_synthetic_2023}. Although initially focused on synthetic image generation, GANs have extended their utility beyond image synthesis to domains like time-series data generation \parencite{yoon_time-series_2019}. 

VAEs represent another class of generative models frequently used for synthetic data generation. Proposed by~\cite{kingma_auto-encoding_2022}, VAEs use a probabilistic approach, learning to encode input data into a latent space in a manner that enables controlled sampling. Unlike GANs, which rely on adversarial training, VAEs  employ a probabilistic approach using encoder and decoder networks to learn and generate data \parencite{lu_machine_2024}. One of the key strengths of VAEs lies in their ability to generate smooth, continuous latent spaces. This quality enables fine control over the generative process, allowing the user to manipulate specific features or generate data with particular attributes by sampling specific regions of the latent space, such as in anomaly detection \parencite{niu_lstm-based_2020}, where VAEs can learn normal patterns and identify deviations as anomalies.

In addition to GANs and VAEs, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have also been critical in the evolution of generative models. Proposed by~\cite{salakhutdinov_restricted_2007}, RBMs are models that can learn the distribution of the training data through a two-layer architecture — a visible layer that represents the observed data and a hidden layer that captures latent features \parencite{carvajal-patino_synthetic_2022}. RBMs have been successfully applied in a range of tasks, including generating user preferences for recommendation systems like Netflix \parencite{nematholahy_recommender_2020} and reconstructing missing data in tabular datasets. For instance, in financial modeling, they have been used to generate synthetic market data, replicating the probability distributions of real-world datasets and capturing complex dependencies \parencite{kondratyev_market_2019}.

Originally introduced by~\cite{sohl-dickstein_deep_2015}, Diffusion Models have gained significant attention in synthetic data generation in recent years due to their ability to handle complex data distributions with stability and precision. As per~\cite{lin_diffusion_2023}, the underlying principle of Diffusion Models is to progressively perturb observed data through a forward diffusion process and then recover the original data using a backward reverse process. The forward process involves multiple steps of noise injection, where the noise level changes incrementally at each step. Conversely, the backward process consists of a series of denoising steps, parameterized by a neural network, that gradually remove the injected noise. Once the backward process has been learned, Diffusion Models can generate new samples from almost any initial data \parencite{lin_diffusion_2023}. This is supported by a study by~\cite{you_diffusion_2023} that highlights that Diffusion Models are particularly effective in scenarios with limited training data, as they can generate novel samples even when very few training samples are available. In addition,~\cite{zhu_synthetic_2024} emphasizes that Diffusion Models, along with other foundational generative models like GANs, have become one of the most widely used methods for modeling the distribution of continuous-domain data and generating new samples. Their growing popularity reflects their versatility and robustness in a wide range of applications, especially as Diffusion Models have demonstrated their power over many existing generative techniques~\parencite{lin_diffusion_2023}.

\section{Methodology}
This study follows a structured methodological process that involves data preparation, evaluation of generative models, and analysis of their contributions to synthetic data quality using Shapley value analysis. The focus is on assessing fidelity and usability metrics to determine which generative model provides the best balance between these dimensions. Each step is further elaborated in the following subsections. 

\subsection{Dataset Preparation}
For this study, three multivariate datasets are considered. These datasets were chosen due to their widespread use in forecasting tasks in the literature, ensuring consistency and providing context for evaluating the generative models under study.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exchange:} 
    
    This dataset, sourced from the study by Lai et al. (2017), consists of 7,587 daily exchange rate records across eight foreign currencies: Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, New Zealand Dollar, and Singapore Dollar, spanning the period from 1990 to 2016. For this study, only the British Pound and Japanese Yen exchange rates were selected using seeded randomization.

    \item \textbf{Electricity:} 
    
    Obtained from Zhou et al. (2020), this dataset comprises 17,420 samples with 7 features, representing two years of electricity transformer load data from two regions in a Chinese province. All features are used in the model evaluation. This dataset is a widely-used benchmark, cited in 27 benchmark studies and referenced in 288 papers between 2020 and 2025.

    \item \textbf{Weather:} 

    This meteorological dataset contains 52,696 samples with 21 features recorded every 10 minutes throughout 2020. Ten features were selected for this study using seeded randomization. The dataset represents a commonly used benchmark in time series forecasting research, with documented usage across multiple comparative studies.

\end{enumerate}

To maintain consistency in training and evaluation, all datasets will be adjusted to contain the latest 5000 samples. This ensures comparable results across datasets while reducing computational costs during training. Additionally, all datasets will undergo Min-Max normalization and handling of missing values using forward-fill methods, if any missing values are present.

\subsection{Generative Models}
This study evaluates three generative model approaches: TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and VRNNGAN (a hybrid architecture). These models were selected for their established effectiveness in time series synthetic data generation and their complementary approaches to capturing temporal dependencies.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{TimeGAN}\\
    TimeGAN \parencite{yoon_time-series_2019} represents the adversarial approach to time series generation, utilizing a generator-discriminator framework specifically designed for sequential data. The model incorporates temporal dynamics through recurrent neural networks while maintaining the adversarial training paradigm that enables realistic synthetic sequence generation.

    \item \textbf{TimeVAE}\\
    TimeVAE \parencite{desai_timevae_2021} employs a variational autoencoder architecture adapted for time series data, learning probabilistic latent representations that capture temporal patterns. The model's encoder-decoder structure with variational inference enables controlled generation of synthetic sequences from learned latent distributions.

    \item \textbf{VRNNGAN (Hybrid)}\\
    VRNNGAN \parencite{lee_vrnngan_2022} combines the strengths of both adversarial and variational approaches, integrating the structured latent space learning of VAEs with the realistic sample generation capabilities of GANs. This hybrid architecture aims to balance statistical fidelity with practical utility for downstream applications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Design and Statistical Validation}

\subsubsection{Bootstrap Methodology}
To ensure statistical robustness and reliable performance estimates, the evaluation phase employed bootstrap sampling of the 30\% testing data. Each model-dataset combination was evaluated through 15 bootstrap runs, where different bootstrap samples of the test set were used to assess synthetic data quality, generating a total of 135 observations across all experiments (3 models × 3 datasets × 15 runs).

The bootstrap evaluation procedure was implemented as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Models were trained once on the 70\% training portion of each dataset
    \item For each bootstrap iteration, random sampling with replacement was performed on the 30\% test set to create bootstrap test samples
    \item Each trained generative model generated synthetic data based on the training set
    \item Evaluation of synthetic data quality was conducted using the bootstrap test samples for all four metrics (KL divergence, Wasserstein distance, RMSE, MAE)
    \item Performance measurements were recorded for statistical analysis across the 15 bootstrap iterations
\end{enumerate}

This bootstrap approach provides robust estimates of model performance while accounting for testing variability and ensuring that results are not dependent on specific test data partitions. By bootstrapping the evaluation phase rather than the training phase, the methodology maintains consistent model training while generating reliable confidence intervals for performance assessment.
\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis Framework}
The experimental design employs a two-way factorial ANOVA to examine the effects of model type (TimeGAN, TimeVAE, VRNNGAN) and dataset characteristics (Electricity, Exchange, Weather) on synthetic data quality metrics. This analysis tests for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main effects of generative model type
    \item Main effects of dataset characteristics  
    \item Model × Dataset interaction effects
\end{itemize}

Following significant ANOVA results, Tukey HSD post-hoc tests are conducted to identify specific pairwise differences between models, providing detailed insights into performance hierarchies across different evaluation contexts.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsubsection{Fidelity Evaluation}
The fidelity of synthetic data is assessed through distributional similarity measures that quantify how closely the generated data replicates the statistical properties of the original dataset:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:} Measures the divergence between probability distributions of synthetic and real data, quantifying distributional similarity with lower values indicating better fidelity.
    
    \item \textbf{Wasserstein Distance:} Evaluates the earth mover's distance between synthetic and real data distributions, providing insights into geometric similarity with lower values indicating better preservation of distributional characteristics.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability Evaluation}
Usability assessment focuses on the practical utility of synthetic data for downstream forecasting tasks using a Train on Synthetic-Test on Real (TSTR) paradigm:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Forecasting Setup:} Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are trained exclusively on synthetic data generated by each model and evaluated on held-out real data to assess practical utility.
    
    \item \textbf{Performance Metrics:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):} Emphasizes larger prediction errors through squared deviations, providing insights into forecasting robustness.
        \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE):} Quantifies average prediction accuracy through absolute deviations, offering overall measure of forecasting utility.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shapley Value Analysis Framework}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Foundation}
The Shapley value analysis provides fair attribution of each model's contribution to synthetic data quality by considering all possible coalitions and marginal contributions. Given the potential for Model × Dataset interactions in generative model performance, Shapley values are calculated separately for each metric-dataset combination to preserve context-dependent performance patterns.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
For each metric-dataset combination, model performances are converted to utility values using $utility = -performance$ for error metrics. The Shapley contributions are calculated using:

\[
\phi_{\text{TimeGAN}} = \frac{1}{2} \big[utility(\text{TimeGAN}) + utility(\text{VRNNGAN}) - utility(\text{TimeVAE})\big]
\]

\[
\phi_{\text{TimeVAE}} = \frac{1}{2} \big[utility(\text{TimeVAE}) + utility(\text{VRNNGAN}) - utility(\text{TimeGAN})\big]
\]

\[
\phi_{\text{VRNNGAN}} = utility(\text{VRNNGAN}) - (utility(\text{TimeGAN}) + utility(\text{TimeVAE}))
\]

For each metric-dataset combination, the model achieving the lowest error value is identified as the winner for that specific context.

\subsubsection{Interpretation}
Positive Shapley values indicate performance improvement, while negative values suggest performance degradation. The analysis enables identification of context-dependent model strengths and provides guidance for dataset-specific model selection.

\section{Results and Discussion}

This chapter presents and analyzes the findings derived from the methodologies employed in this study.

\subsection{Bootstrap Analysis Overview}
To ensure statistical robustness, each model-dataset combination was evaluated through 15 bootstrap runs, generating a total of 135 observations across all experiments. This approach provides sufficient statistical power for robust ANOVA testing and reliable confidence interval estimation.

The bootstrap results (Tables \ref{tab:bootstrap_electricity}, \ref{tab:bootstrap_exchange}, and \ref{tab:bootstrap_weather}) demonstrate consistent performance patterns across all datasets. VRNNGAN consistently achieves the lowest standard deviations across most metrics, indicating stable performance regardless of data sampling variations. All models show tight 95\% confidence intervals, confirming the reliability of the performance estimates used in subsequent statistical analyses.

Notably, the bootstrap analysis reveals dataset-specific performance variations that justify the need for individual dataset evaluation rather than aggregated comparisons.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis (ANOVA)}



\subsubsection{ANOVA Summary}

The two-way ANOVA analysis reveals significant performance differences between generative models across all evaluation metrics. Table \ref{tab:anova_summary} demonstrates that model type, dataset characteristics, and their interactions all produce statistically significant effects (p $<$ 0.001) on synthetic data quality.

The significant main effects confirm that TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and VRNNGAN generate distinctly different synthetic data quality outcomes, with performance variations that are consistent across the four metrics examined. Similarly, the three datasets—electricity, exchange, and weather—present varying challenges for synthetic data generation, indicating that certain time series characteristics inherently affect model performance.

Most importantly, the significant Model × Dataset interactions across all metrics indicate that model performance is context-dependent rather than universal. This finding demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of each generative approach varies substantially depending on the specific characteristics of the time series data being modeled. The interaction effects provide statistical justification for conducting dataset-specific analyses rather than relying on aggregated performance comparisons, which could obscure important context-dependent patterns in model effectiveness.

\begin{table}[H]

MAE & 12,066 & 14,375 & 8,758 & *** \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Model × Dataset Interaction}

The significant Model × Dataset interactions identified in the ANOVA analysis are visualized through interaction plots that demonstrate how model performance varies across different dataset contexts. These plots reveal non-parallel lines, confirming that the relative effectiveness of each generative model changes substantially depending on the specific characteristics of the time series data being modeled.

Figure \ref{fig:kl_interaction} illustrates the interaction effects for KL divergence, showing the most pronounced performance variations across datasets. The dramatic convergence of all three dataset lines at VRNNGAN demonstrates the hybrid model's universal effectiveness in preserving statistical fidelity, while the divergent patterns for TimeGAN and TimeVAE across datasets highlight their context-dependent performance.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/interaction_kl.png}
\caption{Model × Dataset interaction effects for KL Divergence}
\label{fig:kl_interaction}
\end{figure}

The Wasserstein distance interactions, shown in Figure \ref{fig:wasserstein_interaction}, reveal different patterns where TimeVAE demonstrates superior performance specifically for electricity data, while TimeGAN shows advantages for exchange data. These crossing lines exemplify how geometric similarity preservation varies significantly by dataset characteristics.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/interaction_wasserstein.png}
\caption{Model × Dataset interaction effects for Wasserstein distance}
\label{fig:wasserstein_interaction}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:rmse_interaction} and \ref{fig:mae_interaction} display the forecasting performance interactions, where weather data presents unique challenges for all models, particularly affecting TimeVAE performance. The near-parallel lines for electricity and exchange data in both RMSE and MAE suggest more consistent relative model performance for these forecasting metrics across these datasets.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/interaction_rmse.png}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/interaction_mae.png}
\caption{Model × Dataset interaction effects for MAE}
\label{fig:mae_interaction}
\end{figure}

These interaction patterns validate the statistical findings from the ANOVA analysis, demonstrating that model selection cannot be made universally but must consider the specific properties of the target dataset. The varying interaction strengths across metrics further indicate that different aspects of synthetic data quality—statistical fidelity versus forecasting utility—are affected differently by dataset characteristics, necessitating the dataset-specific Shapley analysis that follows.


\subsubsection{Tukey-HSD Post-Hoc Results}

Following the confirmation of statistically significant differences between models in the ANOVA analysis, Tukey HSD post-hoc tests were conducted to examine the specific patterns of these differences and identify exactly where the models differ from one another. This analysis provides detailed insights into the pairwise comparisons between TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and VRNNGAN across all evaluation metrics.

The post-hoc analysis reveals consistent performance hierarchies across metrics, with distinct groupings that highlight each model's relative strengths and weaknesses. For KL divergence (Table \ref{tab:tukey_kl}), which measures the divergence of synthetic data distributions from the real bootstrapped data distribution (serving as the reference), VRNNGAN demonstrates substantially superior performance with a mean value of 1.64, forming its own distinct group (c). TimeGAN and TimeVAE show relatively similar but significantly different performance levels, with TimeGAN (13.16, group a) slightly outperforming TimeVAE (13.33, group b). This pattern indicates that while both individual models struggle with statistical fidelity compared to the hybrid approach, TimeGAN maintains marginally better distributional similarity to the real reference data.
% KL Divergence Tukey HSD Results
\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Tukey HSD Post-Hoc Analysis for KL Divergence}

TimeGAN & 13.1554 & a \\
TimeVAE & 13.3337 & b \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\footnotesize
\end{table}

The Wasserstein distance results (Table \ref{tab:tukey_wasserstein}) reveal a different performance ranking, where all three models form distinct statistical groups despite relatively small absolute differences. VRNNGAN again achieves the best performance (0.142, group c), followed by TimeVAE (0.148, group b) and TimeGAN (0.149, group a). The closer clustering of values suggests that geometric similarity preservation shows less dramatic differences between models compared to statistical divergence measures.

TimeVAE & 0.1481 & b \\
TimeGAN & 0.1488 & a \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\footnotesize
\end{table}

For forecasting performance metrics, the post-hoc analysis demonstrates more pronounced differences between models. In RMSE evaluation (Table \ref{tab:tukey_rmse}), VRNNGAN maintains its superior performance (0.220, group c), while TimeGAN (0.259, group a) significantly outperforms TimeVAE (0.629, group b). This substantial gap indicates that TimeVAE's approach to latent space modeling may not effectively capture the temporal dependencies necessary for accurate forecasting. Similarly, MAE results (Table \ref{tab:tukey_mae}) confirm this pattern, with VRNNGAN (0.149, group c) leading, followed by TimeGAN (0.181, group a), and TimeVAE showing notably higher error rates (0.412, group b).

\end{table}

The consistent emergence of three distinct statistical groups across all metrics confirms that each model contributes unique characteristics to synthetic data generation. VRNNGAN's consistent placement in the superior performance group (c) across all metrics validates the effectiveness of hybrid architectures in balancing multiple aspects of data quality. The varying relative positions of TimeGAN and TimeVAE across different metrics highlight the trade-offs inherent in different generative approaches, with TimeGAN showing particular strength in forecasting tasks and TimeVAE demonstrating competitive performance in certain geometric similarity measures.

\subsection{Shapley Value Analysis}
The Shapley analysis reveals the individual contributions of each model component to the overall performance across different metrics and datasets. For each metric evaluated, the analysis examines the marginal contributions and interactions between model components.

The comprehensive analysis across datasets reveals distinct patterns in model effectiveness. VRNNGAN demonstrates consistent superiority across most metrics and datasets, with particularly strong performance in statistical fidelity measures (KL divergence) and forecasting accuracy (RMSE, MAE). However, individual models show dataset-specific advantages: TimeVAE excels in geometric similarity preservation for electricity data, while TimeGAN demonstrates superior Wasserstein distance performance for exchange data. 

\subsubsection{Electricity Dataset Results}

The electricity dataset demonstrates VRNNGAN's strong performance across most evaluation metrics, with the notable exception of Wasserstein distance where TimeVAE shows superior geometric similarity preservation. Table \ref{tab:shapley_electricity} shows that VRNNGAN achieves the highest Shapley values for KL divergence (0.883), RMSE (0.186), and MAE (0.125), indicating consistent effectiveness in both statistical fidelity and forecasting utility.

\subsubsection{Exchange Dataset Results}
The exchange dataset analysis reveals VRNNGAN's dominance across most metrics, with notable exceptions in geometric similarity preservation. Table \ref{tab:shapley_exchange} demonstrates that for KL divergence, VRNNGAN achieves the highest Shapley value (0.964), indicating exceptional statistical fidelity preservation. However, TimeGAN demonstrates superior performance for Wasserstein distance (0.054), suggesting better geometric similarity modeling for this specific financial dataset context.

\subsubsection{Weather Dataset Results}
The weather dataset presents the most challenging context for synthetic data generation, evidenced by the emergence of negative Shapley contributions. Table \ref{tab:shapley_weather} reveals that VRNNGAN maintains superior performance across all metrics, with particularly strong contributions for KL divergence (3.072). Notably, TimeGAN exhibits negative contributions for RMSE (-0.396) and MAE (-0.232), indicating that its inclusion in coalition modeling actually degrades forecasting performance for this complex meteorological dataset.

\subsection{Discussion}

The statistical analysis reveals a coherent pattern of findings that illuminate both the individual strengths of generative models and their complex interactions with dataset characteristics. The significant main effects identified through ANOVA (all F-statistics $>$ 100, p $<$ 0.001) combined with the Tukey HSD post-hoc results establish VRNNGAN's consistent superiority across evaluation metrics, while the substantial Model × Dataset interactions demonstrate that synthetic data generation effectiveness is fundamentally context-dependent rather than universal.

This statistical foundation provides empirical support for the Shapley value analysis, which reveals that VRNNGAN's advantages stem from genuine architectural synergy rather than merely additive benefits of combining VAE and GAN approaches. The hybrid model's KL divergence scores ranging from 0.883 to 3.072 compared to individual models' scores of 8.908 to 17.291 demonstrate substantial improvements in statistical fidelity, while RMSE improvements of 24-57\% over the best individual model performance confirm enhanced practical utility. These findings are consistent with~\cite{yoon_time-series_2019} and~\cite{desai_timevae_2021}, who identified distinct strengths in adversarial versus variational approaches, but this study extends their work by providing new quantitative evidence of context-dependent effectiveness through interpretable attribution analysis.

Most notably, the Wasserstein distance metric reveals the clearest evidence of context-dependent model effectiveness, with each dataset favoring a different generative approach for geometric similarity preservation. For electricity data, TimeVAE achieves the highest Shapley value (0.033), demonstrating the effectiveness of variational approaches for structured temporal patterns with regular load distributions. In contrast, exchange data favors TimeGAN (0.054), indicating that adversarial training better captures the stochastic volatility and irregular patterns characteristic of financial time series. Weather data shows VRNNGAN's superiority (0.129), suggesting that the most complex meteorological patterns require hybrid architectural approaches to achieve optimal geometric similarity preservation. This pattern provides compelling evidence that geometric similarity—as measured by Wasserstein distance—is fundamentally influenced by dataset-specific temporal characteristics in ways that favor different generative paradigms.

The emergence of negative Shapley values for TimeGAN in weather data forecasting (-0.396 RMSE, -0.232 MAE) reveals previously undocumented limitations that occur when adversarial training encounters complex meteorological patterns with intricate interdependencies. This finding sheds new light compared to~\cite{lu_machine_2024}'s general observations about trade-offs between statistical accuracy and practical utility, demonstrating that these trade-offs can be severe enough to result in performance degradation rather than simply reduced effectiveness.



% The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different generative model approaches for synthetic time series data generation, revealing patterns that both confirm and extend existing knowledge in the field.

% \subsubsection{Hybrid Architecture Superiority and Model Performance Patterns}

% The consistent dominance of VRNNGAN across all evaluation contexts demonstrates the effectiveness of combining VAE and GAN architectures to leverage complementary strengths. This study provides new empirical evidence through Shapley value analysis, revealing that the hybrid advantage represents genuine architectural synergy rather than merely additive effects. VRNNGAN's superior performance can be attributed to its combination of VAE's structured latent space learning with GAN's adversarial training, enabling more accurate preservation of statistical properties (KL divergence scores ranging from 0.883 to 3.072 compared to individual models' scores of 8.908 to 17.291) and improved downstream task performance with RMSE improvements of 24-57\% compared to the best individual model performance across datasets.

% The differential performance of TimeGAN and TimeVAE across metrics reveals fundamental trade-offs in generative model design that extend previous literature findings. These results are consistent with \cite{yoon_time-series_2019} and \cite{desai_timevae_2021}, who identified distinct strengths in adversarial versus variational approaches, but this study provides new quantitative evidence of their context-dependent effectiveness. TimeGAN's superior performance in specific contexts (particularly Wasserstein distance for exchange data: 0.054 vs. competitors' 0.118-0.172) confirms the effectiveness of adversarial training for certain types of temporal pattern preservation. However, the emergence of negative Shapley values for weather data forecasting (-0.396 RMSE, -0.232 MAE) reveals previously undocumented limitations in complex, multi-feature meteorological contexts. TimeVAE's strength in geometric similarity preservation for electricity data (Wasserstein distance: 0.033) while showing poor forecasting performance (RMSE: 1.440 for weather data) demonstrates the classic trade-off between statistical accuracy and practical utility identified by \cite{lu_machine_2024}.

% \subsubsection{Dataset Complexity and Model-Context Interactions}

% The significant Model × Dataset interactions identified through ANOVA analysis (all F-statistics > 100, p < 0.001) reveal that dataset characteristics fundamentally influence model effectiveness in ways not fully explored in previous literature. This finding challenges the common practice of universal model benchmarking and supports the need for context-aware model selection. The relatively consistent performance across models for electricity data (low bootstrap standard deviations: 0.001-0.043) suggests that this dataset represents a more structured, predictable temporal pattern that all models can reasonably capture, aligning with \cite{zhou_informer_2021}, who noted the regularity of electrical load patterns. 

% Conversely, the substantial performance degradation observed for all models on weather data, particularly TimeVAE's poor forecasting performance (RMSE: 1.440 vs. 0.186-0.345 for other models), reflects the inherent complexity of meteorological time series. The mixed performance patterns observed for exchange data—where TimeGAN excels in geometric similarity (0.054 Wasserstein distance) while VRNNGAN dominates other metrics—reflects the unique properties of financial time series identified by \cite{lai_modeling_2018}, where exchange rates exhibit both stochastic volatility and subtle temporal dependencies that different architectural approaches capture with varying effectiveness.

% \subsubsection{Methodological Contributions and Practical Implications}

% The application of Shapley value analysis to generative model evaluation represents a significant methodological advancement that addresses evaluation challenges identified in recent literature reviews. This approach is consistent with calls for more interpretable evaluation frameworks by \cite{goyal_systematic_2024}, while providing a novel solution to the attribution problem in synthetic data quality assessment. The bootstrap methodology with 15 iterations per model-dataset combination (generating 135 total observations out of 1,215 possible model-dataset-bootstrap combinations) provided sufficient statistical power for robust ANOVA testing while maintaining computational feasibility.

% The findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners working with synthetic time series data generation. The consistent superiority of hybrid approaches suggests that organizations seeking to implement synthetic data solutions should prioritize architectures that combine multiple generative paradigms rather than relying on single-approach models. Based on the dataset-specific performance patterns observed, practitioners can make informed decisions: for complex multi-feature data, VRNNGAN consistently provides optimal balance between fidelity and usability; for financial time series, TimeGAN may offer advantages for geometric similarity preservation though VRNNGAN remains superior for overall quality; and for regular temporal patterns, multiple approaches may provide acceptable performance, allowing cost-benefit considerations to influence selection.

\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS}
This study explores the application of Shapley value analysis to evaluate generative models for synthetic time series data generation, focusing on the balance between fidelity and usability metrics. The research systematically compared TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and VRNNGAN across three diverse datasets to determine optimal model selection strategies for synthetic data applications. 

The methodology employed a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrated statistical fidelity measures and forecasting utility metrics within a Shapley-based analysis system. Bootstrap validation provided statistical robustness, while ANOVA analysis confirmed significant model-dataset interactions across all evaluation metrics.

The results demonstrate VRNNGAN's consistent superiority across all evaluation scenarios. The hybrid model achieved the highest performance in both distributional similarity and forecasting accuracy, with substantial improvements over individual model approaches. Model effectiveness varied considerably across different time series characteristics, with hybrid advantages ranging significantly depending on context. 

These findings contribute to the body of knowledge by establishing Shapley value analysis as a mathematically principled framework for interpretable evaluation of generative models, moving beyond traditional comparative approaches to fair attribution of model contributions. The research advances understanding of how different generative architectures create value in synthetic data generation through systematic decomposition of performance contributions. For practitioners, this work provides empirical evidence for hybrid architecture superiority in balancing multiple quality dimensions and demonstrates the importance of context-aware model selection rather than universal benchmarking approaches in real-world synthetic data applications.

The study's limitations include its focus on forecasting tasks using LSTM networks, which may not generalize to other machine learning applications such as classification or anomaly detection. The deliberate exclusion of privacy metrics represents a significant limitation given the critical importance of privacy preservation in synthetic data applications. Additionally, the evaluation scope was constrained to time series data and three specific datasets, which may not capture the full diversity of real-world data characteristics.

Due to the lack of comprehensive privacy evaluation in this framework, future scholars can extend the Shapley-based analysis to incorporate differential privacy metrics, creating a three-dimensional evaluation ecosystem that addresses fidelity, usability, and privacy simultaneously. Future research should explore the framework's applicability to diverse machine learning tasks beyond forecasting and investigate the specific data characteristics that drive the observed model-dataset interactions. Additionally, scaling studies with larger datasets and emerging generative architectures would further validate the framework's broader applicability.
