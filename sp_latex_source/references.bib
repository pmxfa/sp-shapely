	abstract = {Time series anomaly detection is widely used to monitor the equipment sates through the data collected in the form of time series. At present, the deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has emerged for time series anomaly detection. However, this method needs to find the best mapping from real-time space to the latent space at the anomaly detection stage, which brings new errors and takes a long time. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder generation adversarial networks (LSTM-based VAE-GAN) method for time series anomaly detection, which effectively solves the above problems. Our method jointly trains the encoder, the generator and the discriminator to take advantage of the mapping ability of the encoder and the discrimination ability of the discriminator simultaneously. The long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used as the encoder, the generator and the discriminator. At the anomaly detection stage, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction difference and discrimination results. Experimental results show that the proposed method can quickly and accurately detect anomalies.},

	abstract = {Recent work in synthetic data generation in the time-series domain has focused on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks. We propose a novel architecture for synthetically generating time-series data with the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). The proposed architecture has several distinct properties: interpretability, ability to encode domain knowledge, and reduced training times. We evaluate data generation quality by similarity and predictability against four multivariate datasets. We experiment with varying sizes of training data to measure the impact of data availability on generation quality for our VAE method as well as several state-of-the-art data generation methods. Our results on similarity tests show that the VAE approach is able to accurately represent the temporal attributes of the original data. On next-step prediction tasks using generated data, the proposed VAE architecture consistently meets or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art data generation methods. While noise reduction may cause the generated data to deviate from original data, we demonstrate the resulting de-noised data can significantly improve performance for next-step prediction using generated data. Finally, the proposed architecture can incorporate domain-specific time-patterns such as polynomial trends and seasonalities to provide interpretable outputs. Such interpretability can be highly advantageous in applications requiring transparency of model outputs or where users desire to inject prior knowledge of time-series patterns into the generative model.},

	abstract = {In an effort to further advance semi-supervised generative and classification tasks, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy called dual pseudo training (DPT), built upon strong semi-supervised learners and diffusion models. DPT operates in three stages: training a classifier on partially labeled data to predict pseudo-labels; training a conditional generative model using these pseudo-labels to generate pseudo images; and retraining the classifier with a mix of real and pseudo images. Empirically, DPT consistently achieves SOTA performance of semi-supervised generation and classification across various settings. In particular, with one or two labels per class, DPT achieves a Fr{\textbackslash}'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.08 or 2.52 on ImageNet 256x256. Besides, DPT outperforms competitive semi-supervised baselines substantially on ImageNet classification tasks, achieving top-1 accuracies of 59.0 (+2.8), 69.5 (+3.0), and 74.4 (+2.0) with one, two, or five labels per class, respectively. Notably, our results demonstrate that diffusion can generate realistic images with only a few labels (e.g., {\textless}0.1\%) and generative augmentation remains viable for semi-supervised classification.

Considering the deficiency of a methodical summary and discourse on these models, we provide this survey as an elementary resource for new researchers in this area and also an inspiration to motivate future research. For better understanding, we include an introduction about the basics of diffusion models. Except for this, we primarily focus on diffusion-based methods for time series forecasting, imputation, and generation, and present them respectively in three individual sections. We also compare different methods for the same application and highlight their connections if applicable. Lastly, we conclude the common limitation of diffusion-based methods and highlight potential future research directions.},

We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model.

Existing methods that bring generative adversarial networks (GANs) into the sequential setting do not adequately attend to the temporal correlations unique to time-series data. At the same time, supervised models for sequence prediction—which allow finer control over network dynamics—are inherently deterministic. We propose a novel framework for generating realistic time-series data that combines the flexibility of the unsupervised paradigm with the control afforded by supervised training. Through a learned embedding space jointly optimized with both supervised and adversarial objectives, we encourage the network to adhere to the dynamics of the training data during sampling. Empirically, we evaluate the ability of our method to generate realistic samples using a variety of real and synthetic time-series datasets. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed framework consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and predictive ability.},

Membership inference attacks (MIAs), attempting to determine whether a particular data record was used to train an ML model, risk violating membership privacy. ML model builders need a principled definition of a metric to quantify the membership privacy risk of (a) individual training data records, (b) computed independently of specific MIAs, (c) which assesses susceptibility to different MIAs, (d) can be used for different applications, and (e) efficiently. None of the prior membership privacy risk metrics simultaneously meet all these requirements. We present SHAPr, a membership privacy metric based on Shapley values which is a leave-one-out (LOO) technique, originally intended to measure the contribution of a training data record on model utility. We conjecture that contribution to model utility can act as a proxy for memorization, and hence represent membership privacy risk. Using ten benchmark datasets, we show that SHAPr is indeed effective in estimating susceptibility of training data records to MIAs. We also show that, unlike prior work, SHAPr is significantly better in estimating susceptibility to newer, and more effective MIA. We apply SHAPr to evaluate the efficacy of several defenses against MIAs: using regularization and removing high risk training data records. Moreover, SHAPr is versatile: it can be used for estimating vulnerability of different subgroups to MIAs, and inherits applications of Shapley values (e.g., data valuation). We show that SHAPr has an acceptable computational cost (compared to naive LOO), varying from a few minutes for the smallest dataset to {\textasciitilde}92 minutes for the largest dataset.},

	abstract = {Synthetic tabular data generation becomes crucial when real data is limited, expensive to collect, or simply cannot be used due to privacy concerns. However, producing good quality synthetic data is challenging. Several probabilistic, statistical, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational auto-encoder (VAEs) based approaches have been presented for synthetic tabular data generation. Once generated, evaluating the quality of the synthetic data is quite challenging. Some of the traditional metrics have been used in the literature but there is lack of a common, robust, and single metric. This makes it difficult to properly compare the effectiveness of different synthetic tabular data generation methods. In this paper we propose a new universal metric, TabSynDex, for robust evaluation of synthetic data. The proposed metric assesses the similarity of synthetic data with real data through different component scores which evaluate the characteristics that are desirable for ``high quality'' synthetic data. Being a single score metric and having an implicit bound, TabSynDex can also be used to observe and evaluate the training of neural network based approaches. This would help in obtaining insights that was not possible earlier. We present several baseline models for comparative analysis of the proposed evaluation metric with existing generative models. We also give a comparative analysis between TabSynDex and existing synthetic tabular data evaluation metrics. This shows the effectiveness and universality of our metric over the existing metrics.

	abstract = {Synthetic data is an increasingly popular tool for training deep learning models, especially in computer vision but also in other areas. In this work, we attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the various directions in the development and application of synthetic data. First, we discuss synthetic datasets for basic computer vision problems, both low-level (e.g., optical flow estimation) and high-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), synthetic environments and datasets for outdoor and urban scenes (autonomous driving), indoor scenes (indoor navigation), aerial navigation, simulation environments for robotics, applications of synthetic data outside computer vision (in neural programming, bioinformatics, NLP, and more); we also survey the work on improving synthetic data development and alternative ways to produce it such as GANs. Second, we discuss in detail the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem that inevitably arises in applications of synthetic data, including synthetic-to-real refinement with GAN-based models and domain adaptation at the feature/model level without explicit data transformations. Third, we turn to privacy-related applications of synthetic data and review the work on generating synthetic datasets with differential privacy guarantees. We conclude by highlighting the most promising directions for further work in synthetic data studies.},

	abstract = {Synthetic data consists of artificially generated data. When data are scarce, or of poor quality, synthetic data can be used, for example, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a state-of-the-art deep generative models that can generate novel synthetic samples that follow the underlying data distribution of the original dataset. Reviews on synthetic data generation and on GANs have already been written. However, none in the relevant literature, to the best of our knowledge, has explicitly combined these two topics. This survey aims to fill this gap and provide useful material to new researchers in this field. That is, we aim to provide a survey that combines synthetic data generation and GANs, and that can act as a good and strong starting point for new researchers in the field, so that they have a general overview of the key contributions and useful references. We have conducted a review of the state-of-the-art by querying four major databases: Web of Sciences (WoS), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. This allowed us to gain insights into the most relevant authors, the most relevant scientific journals in the area, the most cited papers, the most significant research areas, the most important institutions, and the most relevant GAN architectures. GANs were thoroughly reviewed, as well as their most common training problems, their most important breakthroughs, and a focus on GAN architectures for tabular data. Further, the main algorithms for generating synthetic data, their applications and our thoughts on these methods are also expressed. Finally, we reviewed the main techniques for evaluating the quality of synthetic data (especially tabular data) and provided a schematic overview of the information presented in this paper.},

Such broad potential motivated the development of new algorithms, specialized in data generation for specific data formats and Machine Learning (ML) tasks. However, one of the most common data formats used in industrial applications, tabular data, is generally overlooked; Literature analyses are scarce, state-of-the-art methods are spread across domains or ML tasks and there is little to no distinction among the main types of mechanism underlying synthetic data generation algorithms. In this paper, we analyze tabular and latent space synthetic data generation algorithms. Specifically, we propose a unified taxonomy as an extension and generalization of previous taxonomies, review 70 generation algorithms across six ML problems, distinguish the main generation mechanisms identified into six categories, describe each type of generation mechanism, discuss metrics to evaluate the quality of synthetic data and provide recommendations for future research. We expect this study to assist researchers and practitioners identify relevant gaps in the literature and design better and more informed practices with synthetic data.},

To this end, different mechanisms have been used across different domains, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies like Synthetic Data Generation, which aim to protect user-sensitive data and prevent misuse among different domains. Then, Synthetic data has been used not only to augment datasets and balance classes but also in applications of data analysis paradigms that aim to provide useful insights in terms of utility while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. Still, there is a gap in the conceptual and state-of-the-art understanding of the level of privacy synthetic data generators can provide and how they affect various industries and fields. This systematic review attempts to address how privacy has been assessed and measured in the framework of synthetic data generation, and getting to know which metrics have been used to evaluate those mechanisms. We provide an overview with a total of 105 recent studies in this field after a screening process and identify future open research directions. The main findings include a high prevalence of differential privacy as a privacy-preserving technique and privacy budget cost as a trade-off metric, with a high percentage of GAN-based model implementations, and mainly healthcare applications.

Several approaches address this concern, from techniques like data anonymisation to secure, non-disclosive computation, all of which have their specific strengths and weaknesses, depending on the specific requirements. A slightly different approach is the generation of synthetic data, which tries to preserve the overall properties and characteristics of the original data without revealing information about actual individual data samples. The promise is that, for most purposes, models trained on the synthetic data instead of the real data do not show a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we give an overview on currently available approaches for synthetic data generation, and empirically evaluate the utility of the generated synthetic data by testing them on a number of supervised machine learning tasks on several publicly available datasets.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has become an active research field due to its capability to generate quality simulation data. However, two consistent distributions (generated data distribution and original data distribution) produced by GAN cannot guarantee that generated data are always close to real data. Traditionally GAN is mainly applied to images, and it becomes more challenging for numeric datasets. In this paper, we propose a histogram-based GAN model (His-GAN). The purpose of our proposed model is to help GAN produce generated data with high quality. Specifically, we map generated data and original data into a histogram, then we count probability percentile on each bin and calculate dissimilarity with traditional f-divergence measures (e.g., Hellinger distance, Jensen–Shannon divergence) and Histogram Intersection Kernel. After that, we incorporate this dissimilarity score into training of the GAN model to update the generator’s parameters to improve generated data quality. This is because the parameters have an influence on the generated data quality. Moreover, we revised GAN training process by feeding GAN model with one group of samples (these samples can come from one class or one cluster that hold similar characteristics) each time, so the final generated data could contain the characteristics from a single group to overcome the challenge of figuring out complex characteristics from mixed groups/clusters of data. In this way, we can generate data that is more indistinguishable from original data. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our idea with MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a real-world numeric dataset, and the results clearly show the effectiveness of our approach.},

Therefore, the proposed GAN model becomes more robust.

For this work, we design NODE based models as a generator and a discriminator to make the GAN model datadriven. The data-driven approach helps us overcome the unstable training of the traditional GAN model and improve the quality of the result.

One recurrent theme in medical imaging is whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as they are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical imaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more sophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs namely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on well-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were computed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further tested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net trained on these generated images. Results reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for medical imaging applications while others are much better off. The top-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images by FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and comply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is capable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.},

This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99\%, 95\%, and 87\% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Recent years have noticed an increasing interest among academia and industry towards analyzing the electrical consumption of residential buildings and employing smart home energy management systems (HEMS) to reduce household energy consumption and costs. HEMS has been developed to simulate the statistical and functional properties of actual smart grids. Access to publicly available datasets is a major challenge in this type of research. The potential of artificial HEMS applications will be further enhanced with the development of time series that represent different operating conditions of the synthetic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational auto-encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) technique for generating time-series data on energy consumption in smart homes. We also explore how the generative model performs when combined with a Q-learning-based HEMS. We tested the online performance of Q-learning-based HEMS with real-world smart home data. To test the generated dataset, we measure the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and the Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the real and synthetic data. Our experiments show that VAE-GAN-generated synthetic data closely matches the real data distribution. Finally, we show that the generated data allows for the training of a higher-performance Q-learning-based HEMS compared to datasets generated with baseline approaches.},

	abstract = {Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a \$ProbSparse\$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves \$O(L {\textbackslash}log L)\$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.},

Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

We review related work on relational data synthesis, common benchmarking datasets, and approaches to measuring the fidelity and utility of synthetic data. We combine the best practices and a novel robust detection approach into a benchmarking tool and use it to compare six methods, including two commercial tools. While some methods are better than others, no method is able to synthesize a dataset that is indistinguishable from original data. For utility, we typically observe moderate correlation between real and synthetic data for both model predictive performance and feature importance.},

            This paper presents the results of a novel scoping review on the practical models for generating three different types of synthetic health records (SHRs): medical text, time series, and longitudinal data. The innovative aspects of the review, which incorporate study objectives, data modality, and research methodology of the reviewed studies, uncover the importance and the scope of the topic for the digital medicine context. In total, 52 publications met the eligibility criteria for generating medical time series (22), longitudinal data (17), and medical text (13). Privacy preservation was found to be the main research objective of the studied papers, along with class imbalance, data scarcity, and data imputation as the other objectives. The adversarial network-based, probabilistic, and large language models exhibited superiority for generating synthetic longitudinal data, time series, and medical texts, respectively. Finding a reliable performance measure to quantify SHR re-identification risk is the major research gap of the topic.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare applications to perform various tasks. Although these models have great potential to improve the healthcare system, they have also raised significant ethical concerns, including biases that increase the risk of health disparities in medical applications. The under-representation of a specific group can lead to bias in the datasets that are being replicated in the AI models. These disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by bias because they may have less accurate algorithmic forecasts or underestimate the need for treatment. One solution to eliminate bias is to use synthetic samples or artificially generated data to balance datasets. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review and evaluate how synthetic data can be generated and used to mitigate biases, specifically focusing on the medical domain. We explored high-quality peer-reviewed articles that were focused on synthetic data generation to eliminate bias. These studies were selected based on our defined inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and the quality of the content. The findings reveal that generated synthetic data can help improve accuracy, precision, and fairness. However, the effectiveness of synthetic data is closely dependent on the quality of the data generation process and the initial datasets used. The study also highlights the need for continuous improvement in synthetic data generation techniques and the importance of evaluation metrics for fairness in AI models.},

	abstract = {The digitization of medical records ushered in a new era of big data to clinical science, and with it the possibility that data could be shared, to multiply insights beyond what investigators could abstract from paper records. The need to share individual-level medical data to accelerate innovation in precision medicine continues to grow, and has never been more urgent, as scientists grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enthusiasm for the use of big data has been tempered by a fully appropriate concern for patient autonomy and privacy. That is, the ability to extract private or confidential information about an individual, in practice, renders it difficult to share data, since significant infrastructure and data governance must be established before data can be shared. Although HIPAA provided de-identification as an approved mechanism for data sharing, linkage attacks were identified as a major vulnerability. A variety of mechanisms have been established to avoid leaking private information, such as field suppression or abstraction, strictly limiting the amount of information that can be shared, or employing mathematical techniques such as differential privacy. Another approach, which we focus on here, is creating synthetic data that mimics the underlying data. For synthetic data to be a useful mechanism in support of medical innovation and a proxy for real-world evidence, one must demonstrate two properties of the synthetic dataset: (1) any analysis on the real data must be matched by analysis of the synthetic data (statistical fidelity) and (2) the synthetic data must preserve privacy, with minimal risk of re-identification (privacy guarantee). In this paper we propose a framework for quantifying the statistical fidelity and privacy preservation properties of synthetic datasets and demonstrate these metrics for synthetic data generated by Syntegra technology.},
